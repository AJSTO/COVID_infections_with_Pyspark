##  Descripction about project

### ℹ️Project info

This project is created to catch information about reported covid infections in Poland. 

Getting information from government site: [gov.pl - Zakażenia z powodu COVID-19](https://dane.gov.pl/pl/dataset/2582/resource/41901/table).

The aim of the project was to use pyspark to process data from a csv file.
Before using pyspark, data analysis was done using jupyter notebook.
For analysing data was created container with jupyter notebook.
Pyspark was launched locally. 
Pyspark was used to get the sum of infections reported on a given day for the voivodship and the poviat.
The obtained data were loaded into a table in google bigquery and then visualized using Looker studio.
In addition, the Pyspark application received tests that were written in pytest

## 🔑 Setup 

To run properly this project you should set variables in files: 
### ./app/config.json:
{
  "app_name": "YOUR_APP_NAME",
  "source_data_path": "./data/covid_infections.csv", # download CSV file from link in Project info and paste it here
  "source_credentials": "bigquery_connection/credentials.json", # you should put your json key here and name it 'credentials.json'
  "bigquery_table_path": "BIGQUERY-ID-PROJECT.DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME",
  "bigquery_table_path_short": "DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME",
  "bigquery_project": "BIGQUERY-ID-PROJECT"
}

## ⚙️ Run analyse container:

Build image:
```bash
  $ docker build -t covid_analyse .
```

Run container:
```bash
  $ docker run --name covid_analyse -p 8888:8888 covid_analyse
```

##  📊Data visualisation
**To start notebook you should type in your browser:**
```bash
  localhost:8888
```

Next choose a file 🗒️analyse_COVID_infections.ipynb and run all cells to see data analyse.

Examples of charts:
- Infections per day;
- Total infections per month;
- Total infections per age category;
- Infections divided by age categories;


## ⚙️ Run Pyspark locally
- Clone the project
- Go to the app folder in project directory:
Type in CLI:
```bash
  $  spark-submit --jars bigquery_connection/spark-3.1-bigquery-0.28.0-preview.jar --files config.json main.py --job covid_aggregates
```
